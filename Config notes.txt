A session token may or may not be necessary in the config file for a Go AWS S3 CLI, depending on the authentication method you are using.

In the AWS SDK for Go, you can authenticate using several different methods, including:

Static Credentials: You provide your AWS access key ID and secret access key directly in the Config struct or through environment variables. In this case, a session token is not required.

AWS Credentials File: You store your AWS credentials (access key ID, secret access key, and optional session token) in an AWS credentials file (~/.aws/credentials on Unix-based systems or %UserProfile%\.aws\credentials on Windows). If you're using temporary credentials with a session token, you would need to include the session token in the credentials file.

AWS Access Key ID:

The Access Key ID is a unique identifier, similar to a username, that is used to identify you when you interact with AWS services. It is associated with an AWS account or an IAM user within an AWS account.

AWS Secret Access Key:
The Secret Access Key is a private key, similar to a password, that is used to sign programmatic requests made to AWS services. It is meant to be kept confidential and should never be shared or exposed publicly.

Note that for security reasons, it's generally not recommended to hardcode your AWS credentials directly in your code. Instead, you should consider loading them from environment variables, a secure credentials file, or using other secure mechanisms provided by AWS, such as IAM roles.

Environment variables are key-value pairs that store configuration data or settings for the current environment or system. They are external to the application and can be accessed and used by the application during runtime.

In the context of loading AWS credentials, you can store your AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Access Key as environment variables on your local machine or the server where your application is running. This approach helps keep your credentials separate from your codebase, which is generally considered a more secure practice.

setx AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID"
setx AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY "YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"

Replace YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID and YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY with your actual AWS credentials.

Once you've set these environment variables, you can load them into your Go application using the os package.
