In a modular software design approach for your Go CLI that uploads HTML files to AWS S3 and invalidates CloudFront, the main.go file typically serves as the entry point of your application and acts as the orchestrator that ties together all the different modules and functionalities.

Here's a breakdown of the potential roles the main.go file could play in a  modular Go CLI:

Dependency Imports: The main.go file would import the necessary packages and modules required for your CLI, such as the AWS SDK for Go, user input handling, logging, and other custom modules you've created (e.g., s3, cloudfront, cli, etc.).
Parsing Command-Line Arguments: If your CLI accepts command-line arguments (e.g., file paths, S3 bucket names, CloudFront distribution IDs), the main.go file would typically handle the parsing and validation of these arguments using Go's built-in flag package or a third-party package like cobra or urfave/cli.

Initializing Dependencies and Configurations: The main.go file would be responsible for initializing any required dependencies or configurations for your application. For example, it could create an AWS session, configure the AWS SDK with appropriate credentials and regions, or load any necessary configuration files.

Orchestrating Module Interactions: The main.go file would act as the glue that ties together your different modules by invoking their respective functions in the correct order. For instance, it might call functions from the cli module to handle user input, the s3 module to upload files to S3, the cloudfront module to invalidate the CloudFront cache, and the logging module to log relevant events and errors.

Error Handling and Exit Codes: The main.go file would typically handle any errors that occur during the execution of your CLI and provide appropriate error messages or exit codes to indicate the success or failure of the application.

Main Function: The main.go file must contain the main function, which is the entry point of your Go program. This function would call the necessary modules and functions to execute the CLI's logic.

Here's a high-level example of what a main.go file could look like:

go


Copy code
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"

    "github.com/your-username/cli-project/cli"
    "github.com/your-username/cli-project/s3"
    "github.com/your-username/cli-project/cloudfront"
    "github.com/your-username/cli-project/logging"
)

func main() {
    // Parse command-line arguments
    args := cli.ParseArgs(os.Args[1:])

    // Initialize AWS session and configurations
    awsSession, err := aws.NewSession()
    if err != nil {
        logging.Error(err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }

    // Upload files to S3
    uploadedFiles, err := s3.UploadFiles(awsSession, args.FilePaths, args.BucketName)
    if err != nil {
        logging.Error(err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }

    // Invalidate CloudFront cache
    err = cloudfront.InvalidateCache(awsSession, args.DistributionID, uploadedFiles)
    if err != nil {
        logging.Error(err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }

    fmt.Println("Files uploaded and CloudFront cache invalidated successfully.")
}
This is just a simplified example, but it demonstrates how the main.go file imports and orchestrates the different modules (cli, s3, cloudfront, logging) to achieve the desired functionality of your CLI application.
