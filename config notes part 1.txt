Config represents the configuration settings for the CLI

Configuration Management:

The configuration management approach would handle settings such as AWS credentials, S3 bucket names, and other configurable parameters.

Advantages:

Allows for flexibility and easy configuration changes.

Separates configuration concerns from the application logic.

Considerations:

Utilize configuration files or environment variables for flexibility.

Implement a configuration parser to read and validate settings.

Store configuration details (e.g., AWS credentials, S3 bucket names) in configuration files or environment variables.

Avoid hardcoding configuration values within the code.
