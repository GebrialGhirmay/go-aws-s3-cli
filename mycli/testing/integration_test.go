// Unit Tests: are test cases for individual modules or components, such as the S3 upload module, the CLI argument parsing module, or the logging module.These are tests that verify the correct behavior of these components under various input scenarios, edge cases, and error conditions.

// Integration Tests:

// Integration tests test the integration between different modules and the actual interaction with AWS S3.

//In this test file, I can set up a test environment with necessary configurations and credentials to interact with an actual AWS S3 bucket.

//I can also write tests that cover end-to-end scenarios, such as uploading a file to S3, listing objects in a bucket, or downloading a file from S3.
