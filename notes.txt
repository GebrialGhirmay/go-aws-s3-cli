How the AWS and User input module would interact 
The user input module and the AWS module interact in a Go CLI for uploading files through a series of steps. Here's how they could interact:

1. User Input Module:
The user input module is responsible for parsing command-line arguments and collecting input from the user.
It may prompt the user for required information such as the file to upload, AWS credentials, S3 bucket name, CloudFront distribution ID, etc.
Once the user provides the necessary input, the user input module prepares the data and passes it to the AWS module for further processing.

2. AWS Module:
The AWS module is responsible for interacting with AWS services such as S3 and CloudFront.
Upon receiving input from the user input module, the AWS module performs the following steps:
Steps for Uploading Files to AWS S3:
Prepare AWS Configuration:

Extract AWS credentials and other configuration settings provided by the user input module.

Establish AWS Session:

Create an AWS session using the extracted credentials and configuration settings.

Upload File to S3:

Use the AWS session to create an S3 client.

Invoke the function responsible for uploading the file to the specified S3 bucket, passing the file data, S3 bucket name, and other necessary parameters.

Steps for CloudFront Invalidation:

Initiate CloudFront Invalidation:

Use the AWS session to create a CloudFront client.

Invoke the function responsible for initiating a CloudFront invalidation, passing the CloudFront distribution ID and the paths to invalidate.
